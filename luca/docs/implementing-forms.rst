Implementing Forms
==================

Topics to cover:

* How the ``Form`` class behaves.
* ``defaults()``
* ``compute()``
* ``fill_out()``
* How the ``PDF`` class behaves.

.. note::

   I have written this Luca documentation
   to remind myself how to use my ``luca`` command,
   which I maintain for my own personal use.
   That is why this documentation is written in the first person:
   it is simply my own record of how I use the tool.
   It is in no way intended as advice —
   whether technical, financial, or legal —
   about how *other* people ought to be filling out their own tax forms.
